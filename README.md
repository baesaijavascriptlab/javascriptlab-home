## 1. Introduction
This is the code repository for the JavaScript Lab web application, a tool used for administering the JavaScript Lab training course.

It is an ongoing collaborative effort created by graduates of the JavaScript Lab training course.

At this early stage, it is enviaged that the tech stack will be:

- MongoDB
- Node.js
- React.js
- HTML5
- Twitter Bootstrap

## 2. Running the code
If you would like to run the application, you can use GitHub to download the code to your local machine in the usual way.
From there you can run the application locally and see how it works. Use your browser or IDE tools to debug the application and work out what is going on.

## 3. Contributing
We would welcome contributions from anyone who has completed or is currently taking the JavaScript Lab course. Please see Sections 4 and 5 (Enhancement and Bug List) of this document for the list of work we need done. Alternatively, please feel free to propose new enhancements, and to raise new bugs.

If you would like to make a code contribution, please create a Pull Request. Your code will be reviewed by Code Owners and approved or sent back for modification with comments.
